# How to setup a literally free CDN

1. Create repo on GitHub where you'll put your files.
2. Use [jsDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) or [statically](https://statically.io/) to get your assets.

Here is repo I'm using:

https://github.com/adamclasic/CDN

And links to files look like this:

* https://cdn.statically.io/gh/adamclasic/CDN@main/lzjb.js
* https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/adamclasic/CDN@main/lzjb.js
https://raw.githack.com/
https://gitloaf.com
